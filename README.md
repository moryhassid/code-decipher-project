As part of the QA Experts course, I worked on a project to solve a code with cipher letters.

I received a message with ciphertext and solved it using several methods:

Part 1: Text mapping
The code receives ciphertext and passes it to the get_dictionary_mapping function, whose purpose is probably to create a mapping of characters or words (such as a mapping for deciphering ciphertext).
The output of the function is printed to the screen.

Part 2: Text decoding
The encrypted text encrypted_text is passed to the decipher_text function, which is supposed to decrypt it.
The decrypted text is printed to the screen.

Part 3: File decoding
The decipher_file function is loaded on the message.txt file, probably to decrypt its contents.

Part 4: Data analysis from the file
The get_longest_word_in_a_file function finds the longest words in the results.txt file.
The get_number_of_rows_in_a_file function counts the number of rows in the file results.txt.
The results are printed to the screen.
